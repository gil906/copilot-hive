====================================================
  PROMPT EXPLANATIONS - SecurityAdvisor Copilot Scripts
====================================================


════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  SCRIPT 1 — copilot-improve.sh
  "Feature Improvement Prompt"
════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHAT IT DOES:
-------------
This script tells Copilot to actively improve the yourproject project.
It focuses on adding and enhancing features across the entire codebase —
API, UI, mobile experience, scanner logic, design, animations, and architecture.
It does not just suggest changes — it implements them directly.

THE PROMPT:
-----------
"for my container yourproject, improve the website in the API
functionalities, features, details, mobile friendly when coming from phone,
more professional and makes the scanner better. if you see things to improve
on the architecture, design connections, demos, reports, animations, etc do it."

HOW IT WORKS:
-------------
- Copilot reads the entire project codebase in /opt/yourproject
- It identifies areas that can be improved across API, UI, and scanner
- It makes code changes directly (no confirmation needed due to --yolo)
- Changes are saved to disk automatically
- Everything is logged to: /opt/copilot-hive/copilot-improve.log

FLAGS USED:
-----------
  --prompt    Sends the prompt non-interactively (no chat window needed)
  --yolo      Enables all permissions — Copilot runs fully autonomous,
              no confirmation prompts for any tool, file, or command
  --allow-all-paths  Allows Copilot to access files outside the project dir

EXAMPLE OUTPUT (in log):
-------------------------
  ======================================
  Started: Sun Feb 22 01:00:01 EST 2026
  [Copilot analyzes codebase...]
  [Copilot edits API routes, adds mobile CSS, improves scanner logic...]
  Finished: Sun Feb 22 01:47:23 EST 2026 (exit code: 0)

RUNS AT:
--------
  Every odd hour: 1am, 3am, 5am, 7am, 9am, 11am, 1pm, 3pm, 5pm, 7pm, 9pm, 11pm


════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  SCRIPT 2 — copilot-audit.sh
  "GUI Audit & Security Fix Prompt"
════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHAT IT DOES:
-------------
This script tells Copilot to act as a penetration testing auditor.
It tests every button, page, form, and feature in the GUI, compares the
project against top security-scan platforms, identifies gaps, and then FIXES
everything automatically. It also improves the scanner and ensures
professional-grade output like cybri.com, security-scan-tools.com, getastra.com,
and attaxion.com.

THE PROMPT (summary of 7 sections):
-------------------------------------
1. GUI AUDIT
   Tests every page, button, form, link, modal, tab, and interactive element.
   Finds and fixes broken interactions, missing feedback, confusing UX.

2. FEATURE PARITY
   Compares against: cybri.com, security-scan-tools.com, getastra.com, attaxion.com.
   Implements missing features such as:
     - Full vulnerability scanner dashboard
     - Asset discovery & subdomain enumeration
     - Port scanning & SSL/TLS checks
     - CVE lookup & OWASP Top 10 checks
     - API security testing
     - Report generation (PDF/HTML)
     - Scheduled scans & real-time alerts
     - Risk scoring & attack surface mapping
     - Remediation guidance

3. SCANNER IMPROVEMENTS
   Makes the scanner more accurate, faster, and comprehensive.
   Adds more scan modules, improves detection logic, reduces false positives,
   adds CVSS severity scoring (Critical / High / Medium / Low / Info).

4. INFORMATION & CONTENT
   Reviews all pages for accuracy and professionalism.
   Fixes empty states, placeholder text, and missing descriptions.
   Ensures every scan result includes: name, description, severity,
   affected component, proof of concept, and remediation steps.

5. MOBILE RESPONSIVENESS
   Tests and fixes all pages for mobile and tablet viewports.
   Ensures touch-friendly controls, proper sizing, no horizontal scrolling.

6. ARCHITECTURE & PERFORMANCE
   Reviews API endpoints, DB queries, and backend logic.
   Fixes slow queries, missing indexes, unhandled errors, insecure endpoints,
   missing auth checks, and CORS misconfigurations.

7. AUTO-FIX
   Does not just report issues — implements all fixes directly in the codebase.

HOW IT WORKS:
-------------
- Copilot reads the entire project codebase in /opt/yourproject
- It simulates an audit across all 7 categories above
- It makes code changes directly (no confirmation needed due to --yolo)
- All fixes are saved to disk automatically
- Everything is logged to: /opt/copilot-hive/copilot-audit.log

FLAGS USED:
-----------
  --prompt    Sends the prompt non-interactively (no chat window needed)
  --yolo      Enables all permissions — Copilot runs fully autonomous,
              no confirmation prompts for any tool, file, or command
  --allow-all-paths  Allows Copilot to access files outside the project dir

EXAMPLE OUTPUT (in log):
-------------------------
  ======================================
  Audit Started: Sun Feb 22 02:00:01 EST 2026
  [Copilot scans all GUI pages...]
  [Copilot detects missing CVE lookup feature — implements it...]
  [Copilot fixes broken mobile navbar...]
  [Copilot adds PDF report export...]
  [Copilot fixes insecure API endpoint /api/scan...]
  Audit Finished: Sun Feb 22 02:52:44 EST 2026 (exit code: 0)

RUNS AT:
--------
  Every even hour: 2am, 4am, 6am, 8am, 10am, 12pm, 2pm, 4pm, 6pm, 8pm, 10pm


════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  TOGETHER — How both scripts work as a cycle
════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  1:00 AM  → copilot-improve.sh   Adds & improves features
  2:00 AM  → copilot-audit.sh     Audits everything improve script did + fixes
  3:00 AM  → copilot-improve.sh   Improves again based on new state of code
  4:00 AM  → copilot-audit.sh     Audits & fixes again
  ...

  This creates a continuous improvement loop:
  Improve → Audit/Fix → Improve → Audit/Fix → ...

  The improve script builds new capabilities.
  The audit script validates, stress-tests, and fixes what was built.
  Running together every hour means the project evolves 24/7 autonomously.
